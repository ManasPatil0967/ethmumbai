Our project utilizes The Graph for indexing and querying all transaction data. This feature enables efficient filtering of transactions and verification of transaction details, including sector, sender, receiver, and amount. We have created our own subgraph for the complex smart contract that we had. This process was quite easy because of the smooth steps and great documentation provided by the graph.
